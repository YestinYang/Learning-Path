# Studying-Machine-Deep-Learning
Summarize and storage of machine learning and deep learning, for personal study purpose

My complete items are as below:
1. Tensorflow X Keras_Building Blocks.ipynb
2. Tensorflow_Building Blocks.ipynb
3. 

Below are the items have been studied and to keep as reference in the future:
1. Convolution model-Application-v1.ipynb  *from Andrew Ng Deep Learning Specialization Course 4 Week 1* (introduce the building process of ConvNet in Tensorflow, with minibatch training and randomize minibatch per epoch)
