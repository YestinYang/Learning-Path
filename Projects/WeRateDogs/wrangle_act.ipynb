    "# WeRateDogs Twitter Data Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is to gather the data from [WeRateDogs (@dog_rates)](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), then assess and clean the data for further exploratory data analysis, and also training a recurrent neural network to identify the species of dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project focuses on below targets:\n",
    "1. Keep the original ranks from WeRateDogs only, not the ones from retweet \n",
    "2. At least 8 quality issues and 2 tidiness issues\n",
    "3. Including merge data table to achieve tidiness target\n",
    "4. Be noticed that numerator sometimes is larger than denominator in this dataset, and that is the way WeRateDogs runs\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of this project is as below:\n",
    "1. Data wrangling, including cleaning, assessing and cleaning in programmatic ways\n",
    "2. Store, analyze and visualize the processed data\n",
    "3. Summary the first two steps in a report"

    "There are three steps for gathering:\n",
    "1. Download twitter data of WeRateDogs from [GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/new-dand-advanced-china/tree/master/数据清洗/WeRateDogs项目)\n",
    "2. Download programmatically for the prediciton result of dog species, in above repo\n",
    "3. Gather retweet_count and favorite_count via `Tweepy` API, and combine them into a JSON file; then transform JSON to pandas DataFrame, at least including `tweet ID`, `retweet_count` and `favorite_count` information "
